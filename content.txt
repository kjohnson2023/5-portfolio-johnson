Hello, my name is Kylie Johnson and I am 14 years old. I live in the town of Andover, Massachusetts with my mother (Julie), father (Tim), my younger sister (Allison), and my dog (Chloe). My family and I have been very fortunate that we are able to travel to many different places around the world. I am currently a freshmen student at Andover High School. At Andover High I take four regular academics, math, science, history, and english. In addition to this I take French, Web Design, Foundation Studio, Physical Education, and Health. Some activities that I take interest in are field hockey, track, and lacrosse. During the fall of my freshmen year, I played field hockey on the freshmen team, and I am now running for the Andover High Indoor Track team for the winter season. In the Spring, I am planning on trying out for the Andover lacrosse team. In the near future, I am hoping to become a scientist who works with medicine. My father has worked with companies that focus on creating new medicines and I think it is very appealing being able to help cure diseases that currently have no cure. My goal is to be able to get into a strong college that will help me pursue this job.
